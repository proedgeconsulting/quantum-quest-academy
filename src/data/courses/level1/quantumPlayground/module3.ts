      content: `# Double-Slit Experiment Simulator

## The Experiment That Changed Physics

The double-slit experiment is perhaps the most iconic demonstration of quantum mechanics, showing how particles like electrons behave as both particles and waves.

## What You'll See

This simulator allows you to:
1. Fire individual particles (electrons, photons) through a double-slit barrier
2. Observe the interference pattern that forms over time
3. Place detectors at the slits to observe the "measurement effect"
4. Compare quantum behavior with classical particles

## The Quantum Mystery

The key quantum mystery you'll observe:
- When unobserved, particles create an interference pattern (wave behavior)
- When observed at the slits, the interference pattern disappears (particle behavior)
- This demonstrates the fundamental role of measurement in quantum mechanics`,

## Visualizing the Invisible

Quantum wave functions are mathematical descriptions of quantum states that can't be directly observed. This explorer helps you visualize them and build intuition.

## Explorer Features

With this interactive tool, you can:
1. Create and manipulate quantum wave functions
2. See how they evolve over time
3. Observe how measurement collapses the wave function
4. Experiment with quantum tunneling and barriers

## Key Concepts

- Wave functions and probability amplitudes
- Born rule for calculating probabilities
- Wave function collapse upon measurement
- Time evolution according to Schr√∂dinger's equation`,
