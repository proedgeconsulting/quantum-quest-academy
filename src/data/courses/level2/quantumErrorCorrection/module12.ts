      content: "Congratulations! Your extensive training in quantum error correction has awakened special quantum powers within you. In this imaginative lesson, you'll discover your unique quantum abilities and create your superhero identity.\n\nYou'll take a fun personality quiz that matches you with quantum error correction powers that suit your style. Will you be:\n\n- The Encoder, who can protect information by surrounding it with a quantum shield?\n\n- The Detector, who can sense disturbances in quantum states from miles away?\n\n- The Corrector, who can reverse quantum errors with a wave of your hand?\n\n- The Stabilizer, who can maintain quantum coherence in chaotic environments?\n\nOnce you've discovered your quantum powers, you'll design your superhero costume, choose a name, and create an origin story. Your quantum superhero identity will accompany you through the remaining adventures in this module!",

      content: "Even the greatest quantum superheroes need teammates! In this lesson, you'll join the Quantum Error Correction League - an elite team of heroes who work together to combat quantum errors and protect valuable quantum information.\n\nYou'll meet other heroes with complementary quantum powers and learn how different error correction abilities can be combined for greater effect. Just as different quantum error correction components work together in a complete system, the League members combine their powers to solve problems no single hero could handle alone.\n\nThrough exciting animated scenarios, you'll see how the League responds to quantum emergencies, using teamwork and their specialized abilities to save the day. This cooperative approach reinforces the system-level thinking that's essential for understanding complete quantum error correction implementations.",

      content: "Trouble in Quantum City! A gang of quantum villains called the Decoherence Destroyers is causing chaos by introducing errors into the city's quantum systems. As a member of the Quantum Error Correction League, you must use your powers to stop them!\n\nIn this interactive game, you'll face different villains with unique error-causing abilities:\n\n- Bit Flipper, who randomly flips qubits from 0 to 1 and vice versa\n\n- Phase Phantom, who subtly alters the phases of quantum states\n\n- Entanglement Breaker, who severs the connections between entangled qubits\n\n- Measurement Menace, who forces quantum states to collapse at the worst moments\n\nYou'll need to analyze each villain's attack pattern, choose the right error correction strategy, and implement it correctly to neutralize the threat. As you defeat each villain, you'll earn new quantum gadgets that enhance your error correction powers for the final showdown against the leader of the Decoherence Destroyers!",

      content: "The time has come for your final test as a Quantum Error Correction Hero! The mysterious Quantum Chaos Master has created a massive quantum storm that threatens to corrupt all quantum information across Quantum City. Only you and your fellow heroes can save the day!\n\nIn this epic final challenge, you'll use everything you've learned about quantum error correction to design and implement a comprehensive protection system. You'll need to:\n\n1. Analyze the complex error patterns in the quantum storm\n\n2. Design a multi-layered error correction strategy using different codes\n\n3. Deploy your protection system across the city's quantum infrastructure\n\n4. Adapt your approach as the storm evolves with new error types\n\nThe challenge combines strategy, quick thinking, and a deep understanding of quantum error correction principles. Success will require applying your knowledge in creative ways under pressure. Upon completing this final mission, you'll receive your official Quantum Error Correction Hero certification and a special digital badge to commemorate your achievement!",
