          content: "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field that combines quantum computing with machine learning techniques to potentially solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. In this lesson, we'll explore what makes QML different from classical machine learning and what kinds of advantages we might expect.\n\nWe'll discuss four main categories of quantum machine learning:\n\n1. **Quantum-enhanced ML**: Using quantum computers to accelerate parts of classical ML algorithms\n\n2. **Quantum-inspired ML**: Classical algorithms inspired by quantum mechanics\n\n3. **ML for quantum systems**: Using classical ML to improve quantum computers\n\n4. **Fully quantum ML**: Native quantum algorithms where both data and processing are quantum\n\nWe'll also address the current hype vs. reality of the field, discussing where quantum advantage might first appear in practical machine learning applications.",

We'll also discuss the critical challenge of the input problem in quantum machine learning - the potential bottleneck of loading large classical datasets into quantum systems.",
